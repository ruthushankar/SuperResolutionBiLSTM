## 🧠 Video Enhancement

This app uses TensorFlow.js to apply real-time enhancements to the video stream. The enhancement model is loaded from `model.json` and processes video frames to improve quality.

## 📧 Email Notifications

Users can share call IDs via email directly from the app interface. This feature uses EmailJS to send emails without a backend server.
